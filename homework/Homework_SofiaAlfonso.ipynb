    "#####Summary 1: Chapter Pete Skomoroch\n",
    "Pete Skomoroch, now Principal data scientist at Data Wrangling, has been in the Data Science field since the beginning. On his interview, he describes the evolution he has seen on the field and his own career, and provides some insights on how to become a good data scientist.\n",
    "The Data Science role was created to bridge the gap between the theoretical research done by scientists and the development done by the engineers. It was a hybrid scientist-engineer role. Nowadays, some data scientist still fit into that role but they could also be statisticians, business analysists, marketers, or data visualisers.\n",
    "Pete started his career as a research engineer at AOL. He did neuroscience research as an undergraduate and graduated with a strong background on math and physics. However, he was not a very strong programmer. His advice to current people studying on the field is to take as many math and physics classes as possible but to also learn computer science. He believes that knowledge would have helped him grow faster in the industry.\n", 
    "He also advises taking extra time to learn and develop skills, not only by studying but also by engaging on side projects and working with people that know about the field. He believes that the only way to excel at something is to take extra time to learn it, and that ‘anything worth doing is worth doing well’. He would also encourage managers to keep coding because technology evolves fast and ‘the further you get from the nuts and bolts, the harder it is to make intelligent decisions’.\n",
    "Pete’s experience is very wide, ranging from work at the Lincoln Labs to Silicon Valley, and though his career he has seen Fortune 500 companies grow in interest towards Data Science. Seeing successful companies like Google and Facebook makes data science seem like magic, and other companies want to replicate their outstanding results.\n",
    "He explains that in his experience, bringing to life ideas is easier on younger companies and such was the case when he started in LinkedIn. Startups usually have smaller teams where you get to where ‘many hats’ in order to bring an idea to life and with less people involved, the time to execution is shorter. However, some startups fail because they do not hit the product-market fit, and the product does not align to the company objectives.\n",
    "He explains the learning data science requires a lot of focus and finding very good mentors, who would train you and help you push projects through the management levels.\n",
